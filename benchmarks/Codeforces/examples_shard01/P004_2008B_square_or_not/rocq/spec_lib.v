(* Codeforces 2008/B - Square or Not: a beautiful matrix has ones on its border
   and zeros inside; given the row-major writing-out s of one, decide whether it
   could have been square.
   Signature: solve_case(s : list Z) -> Z. The statement hands over a binary
   STRING, so s carries character codes: '0' = 48 and '1' = 49. *)

(* [s] is the row-major writing-out of a beautiful r x c binary matrix: ones on
   its edges and zeros inside. The cell in row [i], column [j] is written at
   position [i * c + j] of the string. *)

(* The statement guarantees three things about the input: the length bound, that
   the string is binary, and that it really is the writing-out of SOME beautiful
   matrix — not necessarily a square one. (Binary-ness also follows from that
   last guarantee, but the statement asserts it separately, so it is kept.) *)
